# Exercise 14 - Building a complicated card layout

For this exercise, let's continue practicing using flex box and CSS. This time we're going to build card that advertises an activity that users could purchase. There is an image on one side and then the text for the card on the other side. This exercise requires a bit more advanced flex techniques, as well as some box shadows, rounded corners and object-fit for the image. 

All of the colour codes you need are in your `style.css` file, though you can use a different colour palette if you are so inclined. The image that you need are in the `images` folder as well.

## Steps

Grab the HTML and CSS files in the main project folder and modify both the `style.css` file and the `index.html` until you acheive the desired outcome. In this exercise you must modify the main HTML file to acheive the desired outcome. Please note that you should not be editing the CSS reset file.
